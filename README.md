Predicting the MPG of an unseen automobile.


Me and my collaborators aimed to use the automobile dataset containing several features for cars to predict the miles per gallon of a car given these measurements. We also aimed to discover which features had the largest impact on several key characteristics of each car, such as zero to sixty time, miles per gallon, and price, such that manufacturers have a basic understanding of how to design a car aimed at maximizing the price of their vehicles.
